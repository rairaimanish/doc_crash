HI Robert,

I am Rishi Agrawal. I have been working in a Linux Enviornment for past 11 years now. I a a system programmer and have been programming in file systems, scripts and user space in last 7 years in industry.

I have read your book "Linux Kernel Development" and found it to be very usefule for anyone getting into Linux Kernel Development.

Recently while working with Crash tool for debugging I got this idea to add some supplementary materials to your book in the form of a free pdf and a github project.
